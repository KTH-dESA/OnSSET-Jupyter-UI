# OnSSET Jupyter notebook User Interface

This repository contains a selection of jupyter notebooks which allow for a quick, screening electrification analysis using a simplified version of OnSSET. Sample files of Malawi are available for testing. Note, that both code and input files are only indicative and are only used here to showcase OnSSET's functionality.

More information about the electrification tools is available at [OnSSET.org](https://github.com/KTH-dESA/PyOnSSET).
